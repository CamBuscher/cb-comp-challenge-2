Static Comp 2!! Fun one. I definitely went with some jarring color choices as it's very hokey and halloween-ey, but I like it, and I think it works for the content it holds, even if it's not something I'd ever design for a company! It was nice to get more experience with flexbox and responsive design. 

Did a couple of media queries, and one was vertical, which I hadn't done yet! But it all works pretty well I believe.
